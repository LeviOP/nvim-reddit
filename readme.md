todo:
- write a real readme
- handle html correctly
  - handle inline spoiler
  - handle table element
- better configuration
  - configurable highlights
  - configurable margins
  - move refresh token into the correct place.. blehhh
  - type config defaults / optionals correctly
- handle post types correctly
  - add progress indicator to gallery
  - handle crossposts
    - crossposts will have post_hint as link sometimes, apparently (maybe all the time on main page?)
- handle rich:video and similar
- support contest mode
- maybe indicate when `more` children returned nothing
- maybe make foldtext children the number of decendents instead of direct children (like offical reddit ui)
- only show link with sticked text on subreddit
- figure out opening large (high resolution) images takes so long with image.nvim
- figure out why virtual padding sometimes isn't displayed until a redraw (probably image.nvim's fault)
- handle buffer being open in multiple windows
- use style linter
- handle score digit count being higher than score margin
- show errors onscreen instead of printing (and use vim.notify)
- maybe make separate wrapped type for state stored on things to reduce confusion
- handle nsfw/spoiler links
- differentiate when `removal_reason` is not null
- support replying (and posting)
- collapse richtext rendering with state table
  - apparently if some markup ends on the word after a newline the markup isn't applied to the line before
  - zwsp after newline doesn't turn newline into space? something weird (handle whitespace more accurately)
  - handle case when single line that is supposed to wrap adds blank line
  - comment the code better?? i have no idea what's going on in there at this point
- indicate whether link is expandable
- maybe render directly instead of rendering text and shifting it around (luajit is very fast :)
- maybe show thumbnails? (probably not)
- maybe do something different with gifs? (we are often provided an mp4, after all)
- maybe show comment depth / parenting with background color change or "tree lines"
- add "hovers" for various stuff
- support mouse
- maybe handle custom emojis
