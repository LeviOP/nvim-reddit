todo:
- write a real readme
- handle html correctly
  - handle inline spoiler
  - handle table element
- better configuration
  - configurable highlights
  - configurable margins
  - move refresh token into the correct place.. blehhh
  - type config defaults / optionals correctly
- handle post types correctly
  - handle crossposts
    - crossposts will have post_hint as link sometimes, apparently (maybe all the time on main page?)
- handle rich:video and similar
- handle duplicate buffers
  - maybe allow reloading?
- support contest mode
- maybe cache blocks for comments and links (instead of just expando content)
- maybe address ueberzug image render failing directly after resizing terminal window
- standardize variable/parameter names to make understanding offsets (0 or 1 based, column or byte based, abstract or direct data, etc.)
- maybe indicate when `more` children returned nothing
- provide way to show inline images in post body
- maybe make foldtext children the number of decedents instead of direct children (like official reddit ui)
- only show link with sticked text on subreddit
- handle buffer being open in multiple windows
- use style linter
- handle score digit count being higher than score margin
- show errors onscreen instead of printing (and use vim.notify)
- maybe make separate wrapped type for state stored on things to reduce confusion
- handle nsfw/spoiler links
- support replying (and posting)
- fix some issues with richtext rendering
  - apparently if some markup ends on the word after a newline the markup isn't applied to the line before
  - zwsp after newline doesn't turn newline into space? something weird (handle whitespace more accurately)
- indicate whether link is expandable
- maybe render directly instead of rendering text and shifting it around (luajit is very fast :)
- maybe optimize all table accesses / insertions (it's already super fast though)
- maybe show thumbnails? (probably not)
- maybe show comment depth / parenting with background color change or "tree lines"
- add "hovers" for various stuff
- support mouse
- maybe handle custom emojis
