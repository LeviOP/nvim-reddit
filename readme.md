- multiple marks for op and stuff
- show errors onscreen instead of printing (and use vim.notify)

- handle nsfw/spoiler links
- fix self.subreddit domains (should link to subreddit apparently)
- differentiate when `removal_reason` is not null
- support replying (and posting)

  - zwsp after newline doesn't turn newline into space? something weird (handle whitespace more accurately)

- maybe show thumbnails?
